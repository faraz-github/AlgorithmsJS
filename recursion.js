// Note: Recursion is a problem solving technique when the function calls itself.

// Common Usecase: When a problem needs to be broken down into smaller problem, recursion technique can be used to simplify the solution.

// Important points
// 1) A condition to terminate the recursion algorithm.
// 2) Not always the best, sometimes it can be far worse than the iterative solution.
// 3) It is not the most straight forward solution.
