// What is cartesian product?
// In mathematics, specifically set theory, the cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted AxB is the
// set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is in A and b is in B.

// Example:
// A = [1, 2]
// B = [3, 4]
// AxB = [[1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2, 4]]

// Problem: Given two finite non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product.
